                            <p>First of all, you need a <strong>VTuber avatar</strong>.</p>
                            <p>If you want a <strong>2D avatar</strong>, you could either draw it yourself, or commision an artist for one. A full-body illustration would normally cost around <strong>$200 - $2000</strong>, depending on the illustrator.</p>
                            <p>A <strong>3D avatar</strong> could also be made yourself using tools such as <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>.</p>
                            <p>If you do not have experience in 3D modelling, you can also commision artists in the ballpark of around <strong>$3000 - $5000</strong>.</p>
                            <p>3D models take a lot more time, skill, and effort to design and create as such the <strong>costs are higher</strong> than that of 2D's.</p>
                            <p>If you are on a budget, you can also simply change the size of the model from a full-body to a <strong>bust-up</strong> one - which is half the effort and thus a <strong>cheaper option</strong>. Of course, this means that you would not be able to move around as freely.</p>

                            <p>Rigging is essentially creating a <strong>virtual armature</strong> in a model for use in animation.</p>
                            <p>For <strong>2D models</strong>, this can be done through <a href="https://www.live2d.com/en/" target="_blank">Live2D</a>. Meanwhile, <strong>3D models</strong> would utilize programs such as <a href="https://vroid.com/en/studio" target="_blank">VRoid Studio</a>.</p>
                            <p>Rigging can also come with <strong>scripted motions</strong> of the character that goes outside of tracking, such as it crying or waving its hand. The streamer can then make the model <strong>play these animations</strong> using shortcuts when the situation is right.</p>
                            <p>Some artists <strong>include rigging</strong> within the prices as mentioned under the Models section, while others do not include it - only providing just a full-body illustration or a flat model.</p>
                            <p>As such, similar to the models, you can also <strong>commission others</strong> to rig a model that you provide.</p>
                            <p>However, the price range of this is extremely large - from <strong>$100 to $3000+</strong>. The animators of <a href="https://en.hololive.tv/" target="_blank">hololive</a>'s models cost around <strong>$2000 - $2500</strong> for a full-body rig, even <strong>excluding the motions</strong>.</p>

                            <p>To begin your livestreaming journey, you need a <strong>broadcasting software</strong> to stream your model and content to viewers. The most popular one is <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">OBS Studio</a>, which is the software that professional VTubers from agencies also use.</p>
                            <p>Next, would be choosing a <strong>platform</strong> to stream on. There are multiple ones to choose from, but the most popular ones are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">Twitch</a></p>
                            <p>The threshold for <strong>monetizing a Twitch stream</strong> is notably <strong>lower</strong> than YouTube's. It also offers <strong>more options</strong> for streamers to <strong>gain revenue</strong>. However, Twitch's algorithm does <strong>not particularly favor</strong> new and less popular streamers.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, the requirements to begin <strong>making money on YouTube streams</strong> are much <strong>steeper</strong>. There are also <strong>fewer options of monetization</strong>, and also takes a <strong>larger cut</strong> of the profits compared to Twitch. However, the content on YouTube <strong>stays up infinitely</strong> until the creator wishes to delete them. They can also upload small <strong>pre-recorded content</strong> alongside livestreams.</p>
                            <p>Overall, picking a platform depends on your priority. While you can <strong>monetize content earlier</strong> on Twitch, it is <strong>harder to build up</strong> an audience. Meanwhile, while YouTube has <strong>more requirements</strong>, the algorithm is <strong>more favorable</strong> for smaller and new creators.</p>

                            <p>For the <strong>most accurate</strong> face-tracking, most VTubers utilize iPhone X's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT208109" target="_blank">Face ID</a>.</p>
                            <p>The technology essentially <strong>projects light</strong> from the phone onto the user's face, and then <strong>senses the depth</strong> of the reflective light using sensors - allowing it to work <strong>regardless of angle</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Since the projectors and sensors are projecting and sensing <strong>infrared light</strong> rather than visible light, on top of the infrared light that one's body naturally produces, the <strong>lighting</strong> around the face <strong>does not affect</strong> the image.</p>
                            <p>If you cannot afford an iPhone X, a <strong>budget option</strong> would be using applications that use algorithms to determine the location of a person's face via <strong>just webcam</strong>. Examples of such applications include <a href="https://denchisoft.com/" target="_blank">VTube Studio</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1279610/PrprLive/" target="_blank">PrprLive</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/274920/FaceRig/" target="_blank">FaceRig</a>.</p>
                            <p>However, the tracking in these applications are <strong>bad</strong>, and very <strong>dependent on lighting</strong>. As such, major VTuber agencies even provide an <a href="https://en.hololive.tv/audition" target="_blank">iPhone X free-of-charge</a> to successful applicants to ensure quality of content.</p>

                        <p>Taking the immersion a full step further, VTubers can also track their full body to a 3D Model - opening up the possibilities of live dance streams and various other content.</p>

                            <p>Similar to hand tracking, this option is only available for <strong>3D models</strong>.</p>
                            <p>You can use <a href="https://www.vive.com/sea/accessory/tracker3/" target="_blank">HTC VIVE's tracker</a>, which is used for <a href="https://hello.vrchat.com/" target="_blank">VRChat</a> as well.</p>
                            <p>Alternatively, <a href="https://www.xsens.com/">Xsen's</a> full-body motion capture system with the <a href="https://www.xsens.com/products/mvn-animate" target="_blank">'MVN Link' hardware suit.</a></p>
                            <p>The latter is the more expensive but more accurate option, and is also the one the VTuber <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/codemiko" target="_blank">CodeMiko</a> uses.</p>
