                            <p>Depending on how strict one's definition of VTubers are, the claims on who the <strong>"first" proper VTuber</strong> is vary widely - from the Virtual Vlogger, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdDpQ461uxNA3odAnpuigAg" target="_blank">Ami Yamato</a>, to even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi-5OZ2tYuwMLIcEyOsbdRA" target="_blank">Annoying Orange</a>.</p>
                            <p>However, indisputably, the unanimous <strong>"godmother"</strong> of all VTubers is <strong>Kizuna AI</strong>.</p>

AI is a pun on the Japanese word for love <em>(çˆ±)</em>, and also the abbreviation of <em>Artificial Intelligence</em>.</p>
                            <p>Debuting in <strong>December 2016</strong>, she made <strong>massive waves</strong> in the anime community and beyond.</p>
                            <p>The character proclaims herself as an <strong>independent artifical intelligence</strong>, hoping to get along with humans virtually through various content, although most were <strong>pre-recorded</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Rather than Live2D, she uses a <strong>3D model</strong>, which some speculate is either through <strong>full-body motion tracking</strong>, or <strong>animated by a team</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Kizuna AI immediately amassed <strong>1 million subscribers</strong> in just a year after. And with her booming popularity, it inspired others to follow suit as well - such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQYADFw7xEJ9oZSM5ZbqyBw" target="_blank">Kaguya Luna</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/bittranslate" target="_blank">Mirai Akari</a>.</p>
                            <br /><br /><br />
                            <p>The VTubing scene was not always as chaotic as today. Originally, VTubers were meant to emulate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_idol" target="_blank">idol culture</a> in Japan, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid" target="_blank">Vocaloids</a>.</p>
                            <p>Between the <strong>pure, "perfect" image</strong> of Japanese idols, and the <strong>digitally generated mascots</strong> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku" target="_blank">Hatsune Miku</a>, VTubers combines the <strong>best of both worlds</strong> - creating someone who is more human than the digital popstars of Vocaloid, while still playing a fictional character.</p>
                            <p>Essentially, a <em><strong>virtual idol</strong></em>.</p>
                            <div class="timeline-image">
                                <img src="images/rise_kizunaangry.png" alt="Kizuna AI being angry"/>
                            </div>
                            <p>However, that changed when a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO_U9Jceps" target="_blank">viral clip of Kizuna AI swearing in English</a> was uploaded.</p>
                            <p>She was merely <strong>imitating</strong> what a character in a game said, but the larger English-speaking fanbase <strong>found it adorable</strong> that a supposedly "pure" anime character is saying a bad word that she probably does not know the meaning of.</p>
                            <p>Being natively Japanese, her <strong>English pronunciation is a bit off</strong> as well, adding more to the <strong>cuteness factor</strong>.</p>
                            <br /><br /><br />
                            <p>This led to a <strong>rise in the foreign audience</strong> gaining interest in the VTubers scene.</p>
                            <p>More fans providing subtitles for VTuber livestreams popped up, making it <strong>more accessible</strong> as well.</p>

                            <p><a href="https://www.nijisanji.jp/en" target="_blank">NIJISANJI</a> began its journey in <strong>February 2018</strong> as one of the <strong>first major VTuber agencies</strong>. Their focus on <strong>livestreams</strong> set its members apart from other early VTubers, who primarily made prerecorded videos.</p>
                            <p>This, as well as the use of <strong>Live2D over expensive 3D</strong>, led to NIJISANJI's success in the Japanese market and <strong>codified the current VTuber format</strong> of Live2D streaming.</p>
                            <p>Using Live2D, it also <strong>reduces the barrier of entry</strong> for people to get into VTubing.</p>
                            <p>Following in its path, the female VTuber agency, <a href="https://en.hololive.tv/" target="_blank">hololive</a>, debuted its first generation in <strong>May 2018</strong>.</p>

                            <p>By the <strong>end of 2018</strong>, there are over <strong>6000 VTubers</strong> that exist.</p>
                            <p>VTubers created its own massive space in Japan to the point of <strong>almost oversaturation</strong>. It is impossible to watch all of them.</p>
                            <p>Despite this, it remained within its own <strong>niche</strong>. After its initial boom, a lot of people, especially outside of Asia, sort of <strong>forgot about VTubers</strong> for a while.</p>

                            <p>Many VTubers began <strong>letting loose</strong> more in their content, no longer pressurized to keep up the perfect persona of an idol, and being more <strong>down-to-earth</strong> and <strong>relatable</strong> to their audiences.</p>

                           <p>The <strong>COVID-19 lockdown</strong> also lent a hand in VTuber's success. With many indoor activities like concerts and conventions <strong>cancelled</strong>, droves of people started to discover VTubers in their <strong>newfound free time</strong>.</p>
                           <p>The top 5 VTubers on YouTube went from gaining 5,000-10,000 subscriptions a week in late 2019 to <strong>50,000-100,000 subscriptions a week</strong> during peak lockdown in <strong>August and September 2020</strong>.</p>
                           <p>Watching these streamers was akin to a straight shot of dopamine during such tumultuous times.</p>

                            <p>This led to an even <strong>massive surge</strong> in VTuber fans as, rather than needing to wait for translators to translate the streams, fans can immediately just watch their livestreams and <strong>understand</strong> - lowering the barrier of entry.</p>
                            <p>One such examples of massive growth was that of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoSrY_IQQVpmIRZ9Xf-y93g" target="_blank">Gawr Gura</a>, who reached <strong>2 million</strong> subscriptions just 4 months after her debut, and eventually even <strong>beat out Kizuna AI</strong> for the most subscribed VTuber.
